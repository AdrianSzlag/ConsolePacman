# ConsolePacman

![](/README/gameplay.gif)

Welcome to PacmanConsole, a C++ project developed in Visual Studio, based on the iconic arcade game, Pacman. In our console adaptation,
the game's challenge intensifies as you progress. With each level, the ghosts exhibit heightened intelligence, becoming increasingly adept at evading the player.

## Geting Started

These instructions will help you set up PacmanConsole on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

The PacmanConsole project is developed and tested in Visual Studio. Make sure you have Visual Studio installed on your machine to ensure compatibility.

### Installation

Clone the repo to your local machine using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/AdrianSzlag/ConsolePacman.git
```

Open the solution file (.sln) in Visual Studio and build the project.

### Usage

To start the application, run the executable with an argument specifying the level you want to play. There are three levels available:

* "1" - Level 1
* "2" - Level 2
* "3" - Level 3

Example of running the game at level 3:

```
./pacman 3
```

### Leaderboard

PacmanConsole includes a leaderboard feature showcasing the highest scores achieved by players. After every game, your score is compared with the existing leaderboard scores,
and if it's among the top, you get a spot on the leaderboard.
